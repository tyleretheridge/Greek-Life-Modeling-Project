# Greek-Life-Modeling-Project
This repository serves as the home for my project that investigates various factors surrounding student involvement in Greek Life at Duke University and aims to predict Duke University students' likelihood of involvement in Greek Life by utilization of a machine learning model. 

The data [found here](https://github.com/Chrissymbeck/Greek-Life-Demographics) was originally gathered by members of *The Chronicle* during their investigation of diversity in Greek Life institutions at Duke in an article titled ["Is Greek life at Duke as homogeneous as you think?" (January 2018)](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/01/is-greek-life-at-duke-as-homogenous-as-you-think)

An article detailing my findings can be found at https://medium.com/@tylerjetheridge98/modeling-duke-university-students-involvement-in-greek-life-6164efaa704b
