# Greek-Life-Modeling-Project
This repository serves as the home for my project that aims to build a machine learning model to predict Duke University students' likelihood of involvement in Greek Life. 

The purpose of this project is to create a model that can classify students as potentially becoming involved in Greek Life at Duke University.   

The data was obtained from [this repository](https://github.com/Chrissymbeck/Greek-Life-Demographics), which was the host for data used in [an article published by the university press](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/01/is-greek-life-at-duke-as-homogenous-as-you-think) in January 2018.
